    <h1>My document about Dwarf Fortress</h1>
    <p><a href = https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/>Dwarf fortress</a> is a video game made in the <strong>c programing language</strong> that revolves around running a fortress of dwarves.  The player does not control a living being directly but instead interacts with the settlement through things like orders which dwarves will eventually do upon finding time based on a number of variables in their simulated lives.  This game is notable for its in depth and detailed simulations, for example every time you generate a world you generate 100 years of its history, empires rise and fall, heroes are forged and remembered, and thousands of lives are simulated all before you start playing the game.  The main drawback of this for years is that it has had to maintain a very simplistic <strong>ascii</strong> style, shown below.  This was until recently when an updated version with fully new art was released on the Steam platform.</p>
